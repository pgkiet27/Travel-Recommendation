This is a final project of course 4: Javascript Programming Esssentials.
In this project, I have completed all the requirements. However, the website I deployed on GitHub is not working as expected. Specifically, the information display after clicking the Search button does not apply the CSS that I embedded in the JavaScript file. Therefore, I recommend cloning this project to your local machine and using the Live Server extension in VSCode to see it fully!
